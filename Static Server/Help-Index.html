To start a server, select Open from the File menu then choose a directory
to serve. A window will open for the server. You can start more than one.
Close the window to stop the server.

To change the port number, enter a new port number in the port number box.
The server is restarted when you tab or click away from the text box.

As a convenience, there's a button in each server window to open an URL
for the server root using the default program. Usually this will be a web
browser.
